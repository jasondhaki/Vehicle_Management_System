The Vehicle Management System (VHS) is an application developed and run on
the terminal. It efficiently manages vehicle entry records in a large parking facility.
This system provides a viable solution to effectively track vehicles in a large
facility with functionalities such as registering new vehicles, removing existing
ones, displaying all vehicles in the facility, searching for a particular vehicle and
updating the entry times. This project uses fundamental C programming topics
such as arrays, functions, conditionals and pointers to create a user-friendly
interface.
